## Detecting Common User/Domain Recon
### Notes
Domain Recon
- AD domain recon is crucial in a cryberattack lifecycle
  - Attackers want as much info as possible: architecture, network topology, security measures, and potential vulnerabilities.
    - Focus on: domain controllers, user accounts, groups, trust relationships, organizational units (OUs), group policies, and other vital objects.
- With enough info, attackers can pinpoint high-value targets, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network

User/Domain Recon Using Native Windows Executables
- Attacker executes the net group command to obtain a list of Domain Admins
  - net group "Domain Admins" /domain
    - If succesful, will display accounts with admin privileges
- Other tools used:
  - whoami /all
    - Displays current user and all security info about the user, including: group memberships, privileges, authentication ID, SID
  - wmic computersystem get domain
    - Uses WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) to display the domain to which the current computer is joined
    - Helps attackers to pivot from a non-domain-joined to a domain-joined environment.
  - net user /domain
    - Lists all domain user accounts by querying the domain controller
    - Used to identify potential targets
  - arp -a
    - Displays the ARP cache, which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses
    - Identifies other active devices on the local subnet
  - nltest /domain_trusts
    - Lists domain trust relationships
    - Useful for mapping multi-domain or multi-forest environments. Shows possible lateral movement paths across domain boundaries

User/Domain Recon Using BloodHound/SharpHound
- BloodHound: open-source domain recon tool created to analyze and visualize the AD environment
  - Used to find attack paths and potential security risks within an organization's AD infrastructure
  - Leverages graph theory and relationship mapping to know trust relationships, permissions, and group memberships within the AD domain
- Sharphound: a C# data collector for BloodHound
  - Runs: .\Sharphound3.exe -c all
    - To collect all sorts of data

BloodHound Detection Opportunities
- BloodHound collector executes numerous LDAP queries directed at the Domain Controller to learn more about the domain
  - Hard to monitor LDAP queries. Windows Event log doesn't record them by default.
    - Best bet is to check for Event 1644 - LDAP performance monitoring log, but some events may not be recorded
  - Better to use: Windows ETW provider Microsoft-Windows-LDAP-Client
    - SilkETW & SilkService: versatile C# wrappers for ETW, simplifies intricacies of ETW, provides accessible interface for research and introspection

Detecting User/Domain Recon With Splunk
- index=main source="XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventID=1 earliest=1690447949 latest=1690450687 | search process_name IN (arp.exe,chcp.com,ipconfig.exe,net.exe,net1.exe,nltest.exe,ping.exe,systeminfo.exe,whoami.exe) OR (process_name IN (cmd.exe,powershell.exe) AND process IN (*arp*,*chcp*,*ipconfig*,*net*,*net1*,*nltest*,*ping*,*systeminfo*,*whoami*)) | stats values(process) as process, min(_time) as _time by parent_process, parent_process_id, dest, user | where mvcount(process) > 3
- Breakdown:
  - Index & Source Filter:
    - Targets events in the main index.
    - Source: XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational (Sysmon logs in XML format).
  - Event ID Filter:
    - Filters for Event ID 1, which corresponds to process creation events in Sysmon.
  - Time Range Filter:
    - Only includes events between Unix timestamps 1690447949 and 1690450687.
  - Process Name Filter:
    - Focuses on specific system/network tools (e.g., arp.exe, ipconfig.exe).
    - Includes events where:
      - process_name is cmd.exe or powershell.exe
      - And process field contains specific substrings (indicating commands run inside a shell).
  - Statistical Aggregation:
    - Groups events by parent_process, parent_process_id, dest, and user.
    - Collects:
      - values(process) → list of unique processes.
      - min(_time) → timestamp of the first event in each group.
  - Result Filtering:
    - Keeps only results where the number of processes (count(process)) is greater than 3.
    - Highlights suspicious parent processes spawning multiple child processes.
